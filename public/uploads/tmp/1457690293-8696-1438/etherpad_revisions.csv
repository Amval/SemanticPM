1;1448485450;The utility and success of Brainstorming as a concept for idea-finding and problem-solution that was assumed by the founder Osborn in the 1950s was disproved in the recent decades. Moreover, 
brainstorming can lead to production blockage since in face-to-face situations only one group member can speak at a time while the others have to wait (turn-taking).

Different methods can reduce the mentioned problems, for example, brain writing. In brainwriting the ideas of the particular group members are not developed during face-to-face communication but 
noted individually. In a following group phase the ideas are discussed and elaborated with the group.

Brainwriting can help generating a broad range of ideas and fosters deep processing. With this appraoch loss of ideas and thoughts in the first phase can be avoided.
